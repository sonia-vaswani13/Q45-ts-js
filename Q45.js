//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
//such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
